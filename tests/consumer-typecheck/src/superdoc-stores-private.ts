/**
 * Consumer typecheck: SuperDoc's internal Pinia stores must not appear
 * on the public TypeScript surface (SD-3213f).
 *
 * `superdoc.superdocStore`, `superdoc.commentsStore`, and
 * `superdoc.highContrastModeStore` are internal Vue/Pinia runtime
 * references. Earlier versions of the published `SuperDoc.d.ts` exposed
 * them as public properties, which leaked the full Pinia store type
 * graph into the public surface and collapsed consumer IntelliSense to
 * `any` at every depth that reached through them. This fixture pins the
 * SD-3213f decision: those three fields are `@private` on `SuperDoc.js`,
 * so a strict consumer importing `SuperDoc` from `superdoc` must not be
 * able to access them.
 *
 * This is a TypeScript-surface hide, not runtime privacy. The fields
 * still exist on the runtime instance and internal package callers
 * keep working. Consumers can no longer reach into them via `.d.ts`.
 *
 * Positive checks below also pin that the documented host-accepting
 * factories `createHeadlessToolbar({ superdoc })` and
 * `createSuperDocUI({ superdoc })` continue to compile with a
 * `SuperDoc` instance after the hide. They compile because SD-3213f
 * also refactored `HeadlessToolbarSuperdocHost`: the raw
 * `superdocStore?` field was removed and replaced with two narrow
 * optional methods (`getPresentationEditorForDocument`, `getComment`)
 * that SuperDoc now implements directly. The internal
 * `resolveToolbarSources` keeps a `superdocStore?` legacy fallback for
 * custom host stubs that pre-date the narrow methods; cleanup of the
 * remaining `as never` casts in `create-super-doc-ui.ts` is tracked
 * separately as SD-3213g.
