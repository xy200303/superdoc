/**
 * Allowlist for `check-public-method-coverage.mjs`.
 *
 * The script enumerates public instance methods + getters on the
 * `SuperDoc` class and requires each to have at least one consumer-side
 * fixture reference (Parameters<>, ReturnType<>, or a real call site).
 * Use this file ONLY for members that are intentionally not part of
 * the consumer-callable surface but escaped the `private` modifier
 * for legitimate reasons (e.g. called by extensions or composables
 * that live in the workspace but aren't exposed through the public
 * facade).
 *
 * Each entry MUST carry a one-line reason. The key is the SuperDoc
 * member name (no path needed since it scopes to one class). The
 * value is the reason.
