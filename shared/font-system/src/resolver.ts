/**
 * Logical -> physical font resolution.
 *
 * A document refers to a font by its *logical* family - the name Word wrote, e.g.
 * "Calibri". The browser may not have that font (it is proprietary), so SuperDoc
 * renders a metric-compatible *physical* substitute - e.g. Carlito, whose advance
 * widths match Calibri so line breaks land where Word puts them. The logical name
 * stays the source of truth (toolbar, export); only measurement and paint use the
 * physical family, and they MUST use the same one or text is measured in one font
 * and painted in another.
 *
 * The value reaching measure and paint is a CSS font-family *stack* the layout
 * builds via `toCssFontFamily`, e.g. "Calibri, sans-serif" - so resolution applies
 * to the PRIMARY family and keeps the remaining fallbacks ("Carlito, sans-serif").
 *
 * Resolution is a {@link FontResolver} INSTANCE, not a global: each document gets its
 * own so two editors on one page can map the same logical family differently (a
 * customer `fonts.map`) without leaking across documents - the same per-document
 * isolation the registry already has per `FontFaceSet`. Every instance is seeded with
 * the verified clean clones (Calibri->Carlito, Cambria->Caladea, Arial->Liberation Sans,
 * Times New Roman->Liberation Serif, Courier New->Liberation Mono, plus Helvetica aliased
 * to the same Liberation Sans). The module-level `resolve*` functions delegate to a shared
 * default instance for callers that have no document context (and for backward compatibility).
