/**
 * Font-system contracts shared across the SuperDoc rendering pipeline.
 *
 * This package owns the *runtime* font concern - which faces exist, whether they
 * have loaded, and (later) how a logical Word family maps to the physical family
 * that is actually measured and painted. It is deliberately separate from
 * `@superdoc/font-utils`, which only composes CSS `font-family` fallback strings
 * and has no notion of loading or readiness.
 *
 * The load-state model below is the contract the load-before-measure gate (T3)
 * awaits: the gate must never measure text in a face that has not settled, or
 * pagination drifts on first paint and then reflows once the font arrives.
 */

/**
 * Outcome of trying to make a single font family available for measurement.
 *
 * `loaded` and `fallback_used` are both *terminal success* for the gate: in both
 * cases measurement may proceed deterministically. The difference is diagnostic -
 * `fallback_used` means no real face was available under that family name, so the
 * browser will substitute a generic fallback (and the renderer should record it).
