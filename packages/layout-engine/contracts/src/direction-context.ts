/**
 * Direction Context Types
 *
 * Typed direction information that propagates from section to paragraph to run
 * during pm-adapter conversion. Each container has its own context type so the
 * orthogonal axes do not collapse:
 *
 *   - section page direction (page numbers, columns) is independent of
 *   - paragraph inline base direction (ind, jc, tab) which is independent of
 *   - table visual direction (cell ordering) which is independent of
 *   - writing mode (horizontal vs vertical text flow).
 *
 * Per ECMA-376:
 *   - Section w:bidi affects section chrome only (§17.6.1).
 *   - Paragraph w:bidi affects paragraph-level properties only (§17.3.1.6).
 *   - Table w:bidiVisual affects cell ordering only (§17.4.1).
 *   - Writing mode (w:textDirection) inherits across containers when absent
 *     (§17.3.1.41) — the one exception that does propagate.
 *
 * The resolver chain in `pm-adapter/src/direction/` produces these contexts.
 * Downstream consumers (DomPainter, layout-bridge, hit testing) read the
 * resolved fields and never re-derive direction from raw attributes.
