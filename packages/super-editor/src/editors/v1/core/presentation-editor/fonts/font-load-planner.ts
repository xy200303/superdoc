/**
 * Face-aware font-load planner.
 *
 * The load gate must await the exact physical FACES the document RENDERS - family +
 * weight + style - not every family declared in the docx fontTable. Two reasons:
 *  1. `document.fonts.load('16px "Carlito"')` loads only the regular (400/normal) face,
 *     so bold/italic text would measure against the wrong face and reflow on late load.
 *  2. A docx fontTable declares many fonts that are never rendered; awaiting all of them
 *     over-fetches and (with a large pack on a slow link) causes a late-load reflow storm.
 *
 * This walks the layout input (`blocksForLayout`) - which exists BEFORE measurement and
 * already carries each run's `fontFamily` + `bold`/`italic` - and emits the deduped set of
 * physical face requests. It resolves logical -> physical with the DOCUMENT'S resolver - the
 * same instance measure and paint will use once they are threaded onto it - so the planned/
 * loaded set cannot disagree with what is actually measured/painted, including a per-document
 * `fonts.map`. Declared-font diagnostics stay separate (`getDocumentFonts()` / `getReport()`);
 * this feeds loading only.
