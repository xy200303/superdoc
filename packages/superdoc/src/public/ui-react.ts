/**
 * SuperDoc public facade: ui-react entry.
 *
 * SD-3182 under SD-3178 (Phase 3 of SD-3175). First supported-surface
 * facade entry (after the legacy mirrors in SD-3179 / SD-3180). Mirrors
 * the 13-name surface today reachable via the `superdoc/ui/react` subpath.
 *
 * Classification per SD-3147: 12 public + 1 legacy/public-compat
 * (`useSuperDocContentControls`, preserved for compatibility).
 *
 * Strategy: re-export through the narrow `@superdoc/super-editor/ui/react`
 * subpath rather than the broad `@superdoc/super-editor` root, matching the
 * SD-3179 / SD-3180 narrow-import pattern. Keeps emitted bundles narrow.
 *
 * Rules for this file:
 *   - AIDEV-NOTE: Named exports only. No `export *`. The supported-surface
 *     contract is the explicit list below plus the SD-3147 classification.
 *   - AIDEV-NOTE: Adding or removing an export here updates the
 *     The postbuild gate `verify-public-facade-emit.cjs` parses this file
 *     and verifies that the emitted declarations expose exactly these
 *     named exports. No second hand-maintained list to keep in sync.
 *     same PR. The verifier postbuild fails on drift.
 *   - This entry does not re-export `Editor` or `EditorCommands`, so the
 *     verifier skips the command-signature probe.
