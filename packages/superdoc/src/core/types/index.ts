// Public-contract type definitions for the `superdoc` package.
//
// This module is the canonical home for the shapes consumers see when they
// import from `superdoc` (Config, Modules, the surface and prompt configs,
// etc.). vite-plugin-dts emits these declarations into the published `.d.ts`
// graph, and the consumer-typecheck matrix asserts each export resolves to a
// real interface — not `any` and not missing.
//
// SD-2869 converted this file from JSDoc typedefs to TypeScript so the
// declarations are self-checked by the compiler. Keep the public surface
// stable: each exported name and shape mirrors the previous JSDoc; new fields
// or behavioral changes belong in a follow-up ticket.
