/**
 * Shared source of truth for the hand-curated set of `.js` files
 * explicitly gated by `check-jsdoc.cjs`'s per-file `// @ts-check`
 * ratchet.
 *
 * Two consumers:
 *
 *   - `check-jsdoc.cjs` — enforces these files stay clean against tsc.
 *   - `report-js-contract-owners.cjs` — classifies these as
 *     `checked-files` (not `unaccounted`) in its public-surface JS
 *     ownership inventory.
 *
 * Keeping both consumers reading from this single file prevents the
 * audit's classification from drifting silently when the gate's list
 * changes. Adding/removing a file is a one-spot edit.
 *
 * To add a file:
 *   1. Add `// @ts-check` as the first line of the source.
 *   2. Append the repo-relative path to `CHECKED_FILES` below.
 *   3. Run `pnpm --filter superdoc run check:jsdoc` and fix what
 *      surfaces.
