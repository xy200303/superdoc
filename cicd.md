## Overview

SuperDoc implements a streamlined dual-track release strategy with fully automated versioning:

- **@next channel**: Pre-release versions from `main` while we build toward v1
- **@latest channel**: Stable versions from `stable` branch
- **@X.x channels**: Patch releases for maintenance branches

All releases are automated through semantic-release based on conventional commits.

## Workflow Architecture

```
main (next) → stable (latest) → X.x (maintenance)
     ↓             ↓                ↓
  pre-releases  stable releases  patch releases
```

## Branch Strategy

- **`main`**: Development branch, releases to @next
- **`stable`**: Production branch, releases to @latest
- **`X.x`**: Maintenance branches for patching old versions

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Core Workflows

#### 1. PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)

**Triggers**: All pull requests

**Checks**:

- Conventional commit validation
- Code formatting (Prettier)
- Linting (ESLint)
- Unit tests
- Visual regression tests
- E2E tests (main branch only)

**Required to pass before merge**.

#### 2. Release (`release.yml`)

**Triggers**:

- Push to `main`, `stable`, or `*.x` branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Process**:

1. Run full test suite
2. Build packages
3. Semantic-release publishes:
   - From `main`: X.Y.Z-next.N to @next
   - From `stable`: X.Y.Z to @latest
   - From `X.x`: X.x.Y to @X.x

**Post-release**:

- Stable releases auto-sync to main
- Version bump commit added to main

#### 3. Promote to Stable (`promote-stable.yml`)

**Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch or scheduled runs at `05:00 UTC` on Tuesdays and Saturdays

**Input**: Optional candidate branch name (defaults to `merge/main-into-stable-YYYY-MM-DD`)

**Actions**:

- Creates a fresh candidate branch from `stable`
- Merges `main` into that branch
- Opens a PR targeting `stable`
- If the merge conflicts, commits the conflicted merge to the branch so a human can resolve it there
- Merging that PR triggers the automatic stable release workflow

#### 4. Release Qualification Dispatch (`release-qualification-dispatch.yml`)

**Trigger**: Pull requests targeting `stable` (`opened`, `reopened`, `synchronize`, `ready_for_review`)

**Actions**:

- Sends the PR head SHA and branch metadata to the Labs release-orchestrator service
- Polls Labs for the terminal release-qualification state
- Uses the GitHub Actions job itself as the required public status check
- Re-triggers automatically when new commits are pushed to the PR branch

Only same-repository PRs dispatch to Labs. Forked PRs are intentionally skipped so private Labs credentials are never exposed to untrusted branches.

**Required configuration**:

- variable: `LABS_RELEASE_QUALIFICATION_URL`
- secret: `LABS_RELEASE_QUALIFICATION_TOKEN`

#### 5. Create Patch Branch (`create-patch.yml`)

**Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch

**Input**: Major.minor version (e.g., `1.2`)

**Actions**:

- Creates `X.x` branch from last stable tag
- Enables patching of old versions

#### 6. Forward Port (`forward-port.yml`)

**Triggers**:

- New version tags on maintenance branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Actions**:

- Cherry-picks fixes from maintenance branches to main
- Creates PR for review
- Labels with `forward-port`

### Support Workflows

#### 7. Test Suite (`test-suite.yml`)

**Type**: Reusable workflow

**Components**:

- Code quality checks (format, lint)
- Unit tests (Vitest)
- Visual regression tests (Playwright)
- E2E tests (external service)

#### 8. Visual Tests (`test-example-apps.yml`)

**Triggers**:

- Changes to `examples/**` or `packages/**/src/**`
- Manual dispatch for screenshot updates

## Release Strategy

### Version Progression

```
main (1.0.0-next.1) → merge to stable → 1.0.0 (@latest)
         ↓                                    ↓
    1.1.0-next.1                         (if needed)
         ↓                               create 1.0.x
    continues...                         → 1.0.1, 1.0.2...
```

### Semantic Versioning

Version bumps are automatic based on commit messages:

| Commit Prefix                  | Version Change | Example                    | Result        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| `fix:`                         | Patch          | `fix: resolve memory leak` | 1.2.3 → 1.2.4 |
| `feat:`                        | Minor          | `feat: add PDF export`     | 1.2.3 → 1.3.0 |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Major          | `feat!: new API format`    | 1.2.3 → 2.0.0 |
| `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`    | None           | `docs: update README`      | No change     |

### NPM Distribution Tags

- **@next**: Latest pre-release from main
  - Install: `npm install superdoc@next`
  - Format: `X.Y.Z-next.N`
- **@latest**: Current stable release
  - Install: `npm install superdoc`
  - Format: `X.Y.Z`
- **@X.x**: Maintenance releases
  - Install: `npm install superdoc@1.2.x`
  - Format: `X.x.Y`

> ℹ️ The legacy scoped package `@harbour-enterprises/superdoc` is mirrored with the same version and dist-tag for every release channel above.

## CLI Release

The CLI (`apps/cli`) has its own semantic-release pipeline with tag format `cli-v${version}`.

### Automated (CI)

| Trigger | Channel | Tag example |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Push to `main` | `@next` | `cli-v0.3.0-next.1` |
| Push to `stable` | `@latest` | `cli-v0.3.0` |

The workflow is `.github/workflows/release-cli.yml`. It analyzes commits across multiple packages (see `apps/cli/.releaserc.cjs` for the `includePaths` list).

### Local Release

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run release:local` | Releases **superdoc → CLI → SDK** in sequence on `stable` |
| `pnpm run release:local:superdoc` | Releases superdoc only |
| `pnpm run release:local:cli` | Releases CLI only |
| `pnpm run release:local:sdk` | Releases SDK only |

All accept `-- --dry-run` to preview without publishing. The combined orchestrator (`release:local`) enforces a `stable` branch guard (override with `--branch=<name>`).

`@semantic-release/git` automatically pushes version commits and tags when releasing on the `stable` branch. This is existing behavior for superdoc, CLI, and SDK.

SDK stable releases publish both npm (via `sdk-release-publish.mjs`) and PyPI (via `twine`). Prerequisites: `pip install twine` and `PYPI_PUBLISH_TOKEN` in your shell env.

### Raw Platform Publish (bypass semantic-release)

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run cli:publish:raw` | Builds and publishes platform binaries directly |
| `pnpm run cli:publish:raw:dry` | Dry-run of the above |

These skip semantic-release entirely — useful for re-publishing a failed platform upload.

## Workflow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Feature Development

1. Create feature branch from main
2. Open PR → triggers validation
3. Merge to main → releases `1.1.0-beta.1`

### Scenario 2: Creating Stable Release

1. Run "Promote to Stable" workflow
2. Review the generated PR from the candidate branch into `stable`
3. Labs receives the PR head SHA, records the qualification run, and the workflow job polls Labs for the terminal result
4. If needed, resolve merge conflicts on the candidate branch and push fixes
5. Re-run or wait for qualification on the new PR head SHA
6. Merge the PR into `stable`
7. Automatically publishes `1.1.0` as @latest
8. Syncs back to main with version bump

### Scenario 3: Hotfix to Current Stable

1. Create fix branch from stable
2. Commit: `fix: resolve critical bug`
3. Merge PR → releases `1.1.1`
4. Auto-syncs to main

### Scenario 4: Patch Old Version

1. Run "Create Patch Branch" for version `1.0`
2. Creates `1.0.x` branch
3. Apply fix → releases `1.0.1`
4. Forward-port creates PR to main

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch

- Require pull request before merging
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- No force pushes

### Stable Branch

- Same as main
- Allow direct merge from main for promotion

### Maintenance Branches (`*.x`)

- Require pull request
- Allow maintainer fixes
- No force pushes

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Release Status

```bash
# View latest releases
pnpm view superdoc versions --json

# Check current tags
pnpm view superdoc dist-tags

# Dry run to preview release
pnpx semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci
```

### Common Issues

**Version not incrementing on main:**

- After stable release, main needs a feat/fix commit to bump version
- Automatic version bump commit handles this

**Maintenance branch conflicts:**

- Only create X.x branches AFTER moving past that version on stable
- Example: Create 1.0.x only after stable is at 1.1.0+
